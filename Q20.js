// 20 .Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ["Pakistan", "China", "Europe", "South Korea", "Nepal", "Japan", "Russia", "Germany", "Canada", "Brazil"];
console.log("LIST OF COUNTRIES:");
countries.forEach(function (country) {
    console.log(country);
});
